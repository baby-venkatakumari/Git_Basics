What is Git ?
Git is an open source and distributed version control system.

Why Git ?
It is mainly used when we work in a team collaboratively--COLLABORATE
It takes snapshot when the existing repo is modified or something new is add to it--STORES VERSIONS
It has local copies even if the central one crashes--BACK UP
It analyzes the things like who committed what version and when the version was committed--ANALYZES

What are the Version Control Tools ?
Git
Mercurial
SVN(Sub version)
CVS(Concurrent Version Control System)

Git and Mercurial is similar because they both maintain a local copy 
SVN and CVS, both works on centralised repository but don't maintain local copy
