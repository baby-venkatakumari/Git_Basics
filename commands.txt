git add "File Name" --- this command is used to add the file which is added and modified to index/staging area
git add -A -- adds all the files to staging area
git commit -m "Type in your message here" --- this is used to commit the changes to local repository
git commit -a -m "Type in your message here" --- this is used for both staging and commiting



Branching :
--------------

There are two types of branches : Local branch and Remote tracking branch

git branch branchname		used to create branch in the local repo
git checkout  destinationbranch	used to switch to destination branch

git branch			to see all the branches in the local repo
git branch -r			to see all the remote branches
git branch -a			to see all the branches both local and remote
git branch -d branchname		to delete a branch in the local repo
git branch -d -r branchname		to delete a branch in the remote repo
git branch -m oldname newname	to rename a branch name

git push --- command to push
git pull ----  command to pull

git clone -b branchname   to_be_clonedURL    localDirectory






git merge branchtobemerged		used to merge all the changes from branchtobemerged to the branch that we are currently connected
git rebase branchtobemerged		used to merge

Both merge and rebase do the same thing i.e merging but in different ways
merge tries to add all the changes to master in a non linear format where as rebase in a linear format.
Rebase adds the entire feature branch at the tip of the master i.e last commit of master branch
Merging is preferrable when compared to rebasing.
